<h1> helloWorld!😊</h1> 
I'm Akash. 

<h3>What I study?</h3>
I study Computer Science at the ESOFT Metro Campus. I currently focus on web and mobile development. I like to learn about anything.

<h3>Why I joined the GitHub Campus Expert training</h3>
I am passionate about the tech community. I actively participate in the tech community in Colombo, Sri Lanka and I learn a lot from that. Most IT students in Colombo do not know about the local tech community and I help to promote it because they are missing out on a lot. Becoming a GitHub Campus Expert will help me in the goal of growing the tech community, especially among students.
