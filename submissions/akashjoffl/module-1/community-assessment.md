### Definition

- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community
  - Current:
      - The current community at Texas Tech is a small one.  The computer
science department is fairly new.  There are generaly the same people at the
computer science events including the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery)
and SDC (Software Development Club)  I am apart of the ECE department with
a major in Computer Engineering, so I am able to see both the ECE side and CS
side.  Our school has one of the best ECE departments in the state and it shows
with all the community involvement, not only with students, but also outside
companies and the general Lubbock community.
  - Ideal:
      - The ideal community for our CS department would be more interactive and
fun involvement opportunities.  Opportunities for beginners all the way to
advanced software engineers.  I would like to have hundreds of people come to
CS events and our Hackathon.  
  - Improvement:
      - In order to improve we have started to reach out to the community
        companies to come and do workshops, infosessions, and just hang out
with us at ACM meetings.  This year I have been able to bring people from the
ECE department into the ACM and it is slowly getting bigger and better.  I am
also doing multiple workshops over the next two semesters in order to help get
students involved more with the TTU CS department.  I believe that the campus
experts program will also help greatly as I have more ideas and help doing
workshops and running organizations.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
    - The CS department has ~500 students with about 25-50 comming to events
      and meetings/workshops.
- How many people would you like to be in your community?
    - I would like to get 100 students activly comming to event's and
      workshops.  I think it is possible to complete this semester.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what
  brought on that change?
    - Since I have been involved in ACM (2 years) it has been the same amount
      of people consistantly being involved.  This year I have been trying very
hard to welcome new people into the ACM community and it has been slowly
getting more people.

### Resources
- What is the currently available to people in your community to learn about
  tech?
    - We have weekly to bi-weekly workshops and company infosessions to get
      students more involved with not only the CS community, but also the
Lubbock community.  We also have a limited supply of funds to buy Raspberry
Pi's or Echo Dot's to do workshops and show off the cool things you can do.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
    - I have been trying very hard to get more learning opportunities to the
      students at Tech.  Last year was our first Hackathon and it went very
well!  We have about 2-3 workshops a month with different technologies.  We
also have the Software Development Club that meet's once a week to work on open
source projects.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
    - We do not have very many resources to give due to funds, we try our best
      to get food and new things at every event, but sometimes cannot get the
things we need.  We do not have a computer lab available to CS students, but
there is a very nice ECE computer lab.
- Are the meeting held during hours where people may be working?
    - Meetings are always held after 5pm and even at 6-7 sometimes.  Most of
      the ACM leaders including me have work during the day as well as class so
we arent able to have meetings before 5pm.
- Is there childcare available?
    - There is childcare available to students by Texas Tech, but not directly
      from the CS department.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with
  that?
    - Since I became an officer I have been reaching out to the ECE department
      and also the MIS department.  We are starting to get more than just CS
students but could improve greatly.  I am not ok with just having CS students.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
    - Our community is very open to other topics.  We have not repeated anyting
      throughout the year because of the demand for new content to learn.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
    - I think they get involved because they have the desire to learn more than
      the theroy in class.  They want to apply the knowledge to the real world,
and we provide the place and resources for them to do that.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
    - All of the people comming to our event are students getting a degree at
      Texas Tech.  I would like to reach out to the Lubbock community as
a whole, but we are not big enough/have the resources for that amount of load.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
    - Everyone is working on skills to get a job.  We have multiple companies
      come for just that reason.  We also do moc-interviews and resume
critiques.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
    - Absolutly!  We consitantly get praised for teaching new things and
      showing new technologies to the TTU community.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their
  existing goals?
    - Our community goals are to increase the number of members comming to the
      events, and also the resources that are available to us.  The amount of
money we get from the school is very linear to member count.  

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
    - We have a specific room that we always "rent" for our meetings,
      workshops, and infosessions.
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
    - We have an office for ACM and also we can "rent" rooms to meet at.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
    - The on campus parking is determined by your parking permit.  After
      a certain time you can park on campus anywhere if you have a parking
permit.  There is no "free" parking anywhere on campus.
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
    - There are multiple busses that drop off and pick up near where we meet.
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
    - It is accessible to anybody, but it is on campus.
- How much does it cost to use the space?
    - It does not cost anything to just "rent" a room for a couple hours but to
      hold our Hackathon, we have to pay depending on the venue(TBD)
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
    - We rent a very nice classroom that is fairly new.  It has multiple
      projectors and screens, white boards, a camera to show the white board on
the projector, and microphone and speakers.
- How many people can it fit?
    - I believe it can fit 150 people. ~100 comfortably.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
    - There is separate chairs from the tables, so yes I believe comfortable
      for everyone.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
    - There are vending machines right outside and also a "sams place" which is
      like a deli right outside the room(same building).  We also try to
provide some kind of food and drink for every event.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
    - We have an office that people can come to and also we have a CS
      department Slack where people regularly chat on.
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook
  group, a caht room or channel?
    - There is a CS department email that we regularly send out email to
      students.  Also we have a slack group with all CS students and multiple
channels.  We have various social media sites but most are never used.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of
  cummunicating?
    - yes we could incorporate not just CS students, but all students who are
      interested into our Slack.  Also a GitHub organization would be cool.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
    - We are very welcoming to everyone, not just CS students!  We encourage
      beginners to come to our workshops even if they dont think they are far
enough in school.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
    - We tend to be very good about decission making, but we have 7 organizers
      to vote on an issue.
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
    - The ACM is an official club with Texas Tech so we have all the
      documentation needed and on file.
- How will you personally handle it?
    - I do not need to do anything with the ACM, but I am thinking about
      separating the Hackathon and the ACM in order to focus more on specific
issues of them.
